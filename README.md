It was a really nice experience to work on this project, a bunch of new things learned, tons of bugs and puzzles to solve. I`m quite happy with the result and will continue to develop my skills.

*Excel and exe files have to be in the directory they are, create shortcuts if needed. There also master files created deeper in the '_internal' folder with warehouse and production history so they could be restored if main excel files become corrupted.
