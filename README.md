This project was made for to improve in data analysis.

## The main goals for this project were to:
#### • Analyze dataset
#### • Offer some insights related to data
#### • Improve
#### • Have fun

## Main steps:
#### • Chose dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilpikulshrestha/books-sold-dataset).
#### • Clean, divide and reshape and analyse data.
#### • Save result to excel for easy access.
#### • Make some insights and suggestions of analysis.

## About data:
Dataset of educational books sold in year 2018-2019. This dataset has four categories of books sold, also provide information about author, publication, information about sales made on discounted books, cost price and profit. Values are in Indian rupee (INR), which at the period under consideration was equal to around 0.012 Euro (Eur).

## Analysis:
Firstly let`s find the most important stats and combine them into balance sheet type table. As we can see revenue slightly increased from 652,271k in year 2018 to 662,290k in 2019. Gross profit grew by 8.6% and gross profit percentage increased to 16.36% while cost of revenue rose insignificantly. However, amount of units sold per year almost doubled, so operating expenses most likely grew, thus reducing net profit. Profit per unit sold shrank almost in half.

Now let`s look at some data by quarters. Gross profit per quarter was not stable, it heavily decreased for a year until Q2 of 2019, then it increased 6 fold compared to the quarter before. These irregularities might be a consequence of educational product nature. It is not evenly required year to year or month to month so a lot of unknown factors could have impact for company's profitability.

Amount of units sold by quarter sharply droped after Q2 of year 2018 and stayed low until Q2 of 2019. Q2 and Q3 account for 82.6% of 2019 sales, however gross profit per unit sold was lowest in Q2 - 2019 throughout both years.

From the table we see, that most of the sold books in 2019 were published by NCERT (National Council of Education Research and Training), so that might indicate some changes in educational program of India. New releases or regulations could also explain why sales rose so quickly in Q2 and Q3 but profit per sale was all time low.

Majority of sold books in 2018 fall into either college or competition category, books for middle and high school accounted for only 6.8%. 2019 is a different story with a bigger part of the pie (59.3%) for school books and more even overall distribution.

Since selling product is educational, it is bought by necessity, so special offers does not have a big impact on sales. Following pie chart shows, that less than 15% of sales are made on discounted books. It is also possible, that discount culture is not so common in region.

Gross profit generated by discounted books does not differ much from regular price profit for the period, except Q1 - 2019. If hypothesis about new releases of books is correct, there might have been sale offers before new version came out. Or it might have been a special offer in order to increase sales, which were steadily declining and lowest for the recorded period at the time.

Sales by day of the week or part of the day also does not show any meaningful deviations. More sales are done in the first half of the day, but that is normal, so other factors should be considered while making a marketing strategy.

Same goes for gender factor, sales are distributed pretty evenly, with a slight edge to females, indicating, that more and more women are reaching for better education in India.

From the pie charts we can see, that Top10 most sold authors account for 53.3% of sales in 2018 and 85% in 2019, again, because most of the sales come from single author mentioned above in the analysis (NCERT).

Top 10 books are responsible for roughly 50% of the sales, so variety of products at the give dataset should be considered. This concentration could be marked as a weak spot and going to a wider spectrum of products might be a way to grow business.

## Conslusion
It was a really nice experience to work on this project, a bunch of new things learned, tons of bugs and puzzles to solve. I`m quite happy with the result and will continue to develop my skills.
