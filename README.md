## Analysis:
First we find the most important stats and combine them into balance sheet type table. As we can see revenue slightly increased from 652,271k in year 2018 to 662,290 in 2019. Gross profit grew by 8.6% and gross profit percentage increased to 16.36% while cost of revenue rose insignificantly. However, amount of units sold per year almost duobled, so operating expenses most likely grew, thus reducing net profit. Profit per unit sold shrank almost in half.

Now let`s look at some data by quarters. Amount of units sold by quarter sharply droped after Q2 of year 2018 and stayed low until Q2 of 2019. Q2 and Q3 account for 82.6% of 2019 sales, however gross profit per unit sold was the lowest in Q2 - 2019 throughout both years.

From the table we see, that most of the sold books in 2019 were published by NCERT (National Council of Education Research and Training), so that might indicate some changes in educational program of India. New realeses or requirements would also explain why sales rose so quickly in Q2 and Q3.

Majority of sold books in 2018 fall into either college or competition category, books for middle and high school accounted for only 6.8%. 2019 is a different story with a bigger part of the pie (59.3%) for school books and more even overall distribution.

Since selling product is educational, it is bought by necessity, so sale offers does not have a big impact on sales. Following pie chart shows, that less than 15% of sales are made on discounted books.

Gross profit generated by discounted books does not differ much from regular price profit.

Sales by day of the week or part of the day also does not show any meaningful deviations, so other factors should be considered while making a marketing strategy.

Same goes for gender factor, sales are distributed pretty evenly, with a slight edge to females.

## Conslusion
It was a really nice experience to work on this project, a bunch of new things learned, tons of bugs and puzzles to solve. I`m quite happy with the result and will continue to develop my skills. You can download this apllication and try it yourself [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vfekzijr6ds3hh8i2ra6b/Sand-lio-programa.rar?rlkey=svv8ing3xq0fnenmi4ja4289h&dl=0).
*Excel and exe files have to be in the directory they are, create shortcuts if needed. There also master files created deeper in the '_internal' folder with warehouse and production history so they could be restored if main excel files become corrupted.
